     Hello, My name is 
     Hassan Haider, I am 19 years old and I am 
     from Pakistan. I am currently doing a bachelors degree in
     Computer Science at Durham University
     My hobbies including playing 
     sports such as volleyball, table tennis, and pool. My biggest interests include cars
     , movies, and video games. My favorite car would be the Koenigsegg agera R, my favorite movie
     is John Wick, and my favorite video game is Call of Duty.  I wanted to 
     create this website because of my interest in cars, how they work, their
     history, and the future of sports, luxury, and super cars.
